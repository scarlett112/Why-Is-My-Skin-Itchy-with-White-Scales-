## Why is nail fungus said to be a dangerous disease?
 
According to doctors at the Regional Dermatology Clinic in Washington, D.C., "Nail fungus causes bloodstream infections and necrosis. There is a solution, but it's not for everyone."

Luisa López: "I guarantee that every person in Washington infected with nail fungus will be able to order an antifungal product at a 50% discount and stop poisoning their blood."Medical science
Luisa López is a doctor at the Washington, D.C. Regional Dermatology Clinic. Below are some excerpts from her press conference: Nail fungus enters the blood and internal organs, which become septic, and the body begins to rot from within. Washington has the highest mortality rate in the world due to nail fungus. Every infected person dies within 10-14 years.
Luisa Lopez, a specialist at the Washington Regional Dermatology Clinic, gave an exclusive interview to: "Why is nail fungus so deadly and how can you prevent death when your nails turn yellow and develop fungus?"

## Why is nail fungus said to be a dangerous disease?

Do you know how many people died from toenail fungus in 2019? Last year, 55,000 people died in Washington, D.C., USA. Of this number, 31,000 died from toenail fungus, which represents more than half of the total number. Toenail fungus not only affects the toe, but is also absorbed into the bloodstream through the feet and spreads throughout the body. It weakens the body from within and puts a great deal of pressure on all organs. Its spores settle in internal organs and begin to grow, causing damage to the body. This causes toenail fungus in internal organs and means that the infected person begins to "rot" from within. In this situation, the person can experience heart failure at any time. When a cerebral vein ruptures, the liver can develop cancer, and the kidneys can stop functioning. Anyone with toenail fungus is at great risk. Frequent colds, heavy work, or stress weaken the immune system and can lead to sudden death.

That's why I consider nail fungus to be a very dangerous disease and one of the leading causes of death across the country. We hear about cancer and tumors all the time, but we must keep in mind that cancer affects only 3-4% of the population, while nail fungus affects one in two people between the ages of 40 and 45.

**So why can't doctors cure this disease? After all, their job is to save people's lives.**

First, let me tell you that most people who suffer from toenail fungus don't go to the doctor because they don't understand the risk of this disease. And even if they do go to the doctor, it's usually too late. Typically, they are prescribed medications that are of little use, and after that, they never go to the doctor again, and the disease continues to progress. Fungal infections require frequent medical visits. Furthermore, very few people understand the consequences of fungal infections and know the damage they can cause to internal organs. I could list hundreds of such cases, but I'll only talk about those that highlight the risk of fungal nail infections.

It may relieve some external symptoms of the fungus, but this doesn't eliminate the risk of fatal outcomes. You can die at any time.

Furthermore, there is also a staff shortage in skin clinics right now. The entire region has some mycology experts, and we have a 37% shortage of dermatologists. More than half of the currently available staff are unqualified. I doubt these people can identify and treat such a complex fungal infection. It's often better for people to stay home than receive treatment from a government doctor. Due to the staff shortage, we have to hire unqualified staff. They all have a medical degree, some with honors, but these doctors lack sufficient experience and can cause great harm to their health. Experienced doctors retire or pass away because they become overwhelmed with such a high patient load, and the stress on them increases steadily. New doctors come in to take their place and have no idea how to treat their patients. I wish my staff were more experienced and more qualified, but there's nothing I can do.

## Is the lack of experienced physicians in our region the reason for such a high mortality rate from fungal infections?

This is one reason, but there are others as well. We don't have an effective treatment for this. Pharmacies sell many types of medications, and if you want, they'll also sell you some over-the-counter drugs that don't help. Outdated medications are useless, and the new products advertised don't provide much relief. Prescribed drugs are also unremarkable. They provide little relief, damage the liver and stomach, and cause great harm to the body. These medications merely suppress the external symptoms, but the fungal infection doesn't go away and continues to eat away at you from the inside.

For these reasons, nail fungus causes blood poisoning and infections in internal organs, leading to death. You can receive treatment in a private hospital, but these also have poorly qualified doctors. They employ inexperienced physicians who don't know much about the diseases and their treatment. The main goal of these hospitals is to extort as much money from the patient as possible. They are not interested in proper treatment.

So what should people with nail fungus do? Is there nothing they can do but simply wait for imminent death? As an experienced doctor, you must address this issue.

Look, it's not like I'm sitting back and doing nothing, but there's nothing I can do about the staffing problem. It's the job of medical colleges and universities to approve good doctors, so what can I do about it? I can't train doctors myself. If we think all this will change overnight, it won't. There are similar problems in other regions of Washington, and people are suffering everywhere.

But when all hope seems lost, there's always a glimmer of hope. Recently, something revolutionary has been developed to save people's lives. The project is likely to launch in late 2020, but here people can receive this treatment sooner than in other regions.

## Why do you think this product will change the situation?

It eliminates external symptoms of the feet and cleanses the body from the inside, completely curing toenail fungus. The risk of death is reduced to almost zero within the first few days of starting the product. Simply by starting this treatment, the patient is excluded from the risk group. This treatment eliminates the fungal cells accumulated in the blood and internal organs. The damage that has been killing the patient from within is immediately stopped.

In my opinion, this product can save thousands of lives.

## What is the brand name of this product and why is it so effective?

This is the most effective treatment for fungal diseases today. I'm talking about Foot Trooper , a next-generation product developed in independent research laboratories. This product was developed by a team of top doctors in Washington. It's 10 times more effective than conventional medications and dermatological treatments. It has no side effects, isn't addictive, and helps the body develop immunity against fungal bacteria, eliminating the risk of reinfection.

The secret to its effectiveness lies in our body's structure. Nail fungus is very difficult to get rid of because it remains in the body's tissues. The fungus usually returns after stopping the medications used for its treatment. Another problem is that our body's immune system can't fight it on its own. At best, the body can slow the growth rate of fungal infections. When the body's defenses are weak, the fungus spreads very quickly, leading to death.

With Foot Trooper , the body can produce special antibodies that destroy fungi throughout the body. Thanks to this, the fungus is completely eliminated from the body. Furthermore, antibodies continue to develop even after stopping treatment. This product increases the body's response to fungal infections 10-fold. After this, you are unlikely to get the infection again. A single course of treatment with Foot Trooper allows the body to completely eliminate fungal infections.

## Why is Foot Trooper more effective than other antifungal products sold in pharmacies?

You need to understand that fungal infections are living bacteria and adapt to their environment like any other living thing. Most antifungal medications were developed 20-30 years ago, and fungal infections have become resistant to most antifungal medications over the years. Foot Trooper 's formula is completely new—it was created after studying the causes of over 6,000 types of fungi. Due to its unique, new formula, this product clears the fungus not only from the outside of the nail and skin, but also from inside the body.

Its effectiveness has been proven at our research center. It was subjected to clinical trials involving several security personnel taking other popular antifungal medications. Their results confirmed Foot Trooper's powerful effect.

The infection in the body does not progress, and the patient is completely cured. No trace of infection remains after treatment. This is why the patient recovers and returns to a healthy life. This also allows the body to develop immunity against fungal infections, meaning they will never get them again.

**This formula has very positive effects on the body:**

1. Destroys fungal infections.

2. Itching, crusting, and burning of the skin on the feet cease after applying it for the first time.

3. Quickly heals nails, as well as sores and cracks on the feet.

4. Eliminates bad odor and normalizes the activity of sweat glands.

5. It prevents disease-causing bacteria from reproducing and stops their growth.

6. Combats fungal diseases such as candidiasis, shingles, dermatomycosis, foot fungus, etc.

7. Removes fungal waste products from the blood and lymph.

8. Helps the body develop immunity against all known types of fungal bacteria.

9. No re-infection due to its convenient packaging.

If you complete the treatment course according to the instructions, all symptoms of the fungal disease disappear.

Are there any contraindications? Why is it sold at such a high discount?

There are no contraindications. This formula is hypoallergenic. It can also be used if you are allergic to other medications and is completely safe for the liver, which is more affected when taking oral medications.
